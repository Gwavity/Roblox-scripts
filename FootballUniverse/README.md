#A Football Universe GUI 
##I have only tested this with Synapse X
AUTOSACK- Teleports you to the QB and sacks them.
INFSTAMINA- Sets your stamina to an infinite number so that you never run out
SUPERSPEED- Sets your characters walkspeed to a value higher than normal
REMOVEJUMPDELAY- This game has a script which forbids you from jumping over and over again, this removes that

All you have to do is paste this into your executer: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gwavity/Roblox-scripts/main/FootballUniverse/FootballUniverseGUI.lua"))()
